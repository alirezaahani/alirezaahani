description: First blog post, using Cobalt and Github Pages
---

I’ve set this up using [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/), a simple static site generator, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting.  
Cobalt is user-friendly compared to Hugo and Jekyll and offers pre-built binaries for Linux and Windows, which is convenient.  
For styling, I’m using [simple.css](https://simplecss.org/), which is extremely convenient.
